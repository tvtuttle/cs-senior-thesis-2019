# cs-senior-thesis-2019
This repository contains the code, paper, and presentation related to my collegiate Computer Science Senior Project, implemented in CS 495W (Fall 2018) and CS 496W (Spring 2019) at Willamette University. The purpose of this project was to create a reinforcement learning agent that could learn to play the Atari 2600 video game "Ms. Pac-Man" via a neural network, using Python and Tensorflow.
The report written for the project is contained in the file "final thesis paper spring 2019.docx".
The Python code for the project can be found in the "Senior Thesis Final" folder. For more details on this code and how to run it, please see the "User Guide to Project" section contained within the report (final thesis paper spring 2019.docx).
The presentation slides produced upon completion of the project can be found in "Senior Seminar Final Presentation.pptx".
